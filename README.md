# Apple Music Rich Presence

[![Rust](https://github.com/valentinegb/apple-music-rich-presence/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/valentinegb/apple-music-rich-presence/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Rust program that runs in the background and updates your Discord activity if
you're playing music with Apple Music.

On desktop, Discord might display the activity like this instead:

Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about that, but at least it doesn't look bad still.

## Install

Right now, the easiest way to install if you have the Rust toolchain installed
is with Cargo:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/valentinegb/apple-music-rich-presence.git --tag v1.0.0
```

The program has only been tested on macOS, and it probably only works on macOS.

## Usage

Just run the program (if installed through Cargo, enter
`apple-music-rich-presence` into your terminal) and you're good to go! I would
recommend adding it to your Login Items in System Settings so that you don't
have to start it manually every time you restart your computer.
